# This is an advanced configuration example

# The workspace tab name can be overriden with the `tab` property
# It defaults to the workspace directory name, which is `advanced-workspace` in this case.
tab: adv-workspace

# The workspace tab can have a docstring.
doc: "my workspace tab"

# Several shell properties can be set for the workspace tab, and for inline tabs defined below.
# These properties do not apply to linked repositories, or linked workspaces.
# You can override the launched shell:
shell: bash

# You can also set environment variables:
env: 
    MY_ENV: workspace

workspace:
  # This is an inline tab, which will be available at workspace-tab/
  - tab: workspace-tab
    # Inline workspace tabs can override the shell property, and set env variables
    shell: zsh
    env:
        MY_ENV: workspace-tab
    doc: "this is a top-level workspace tab"

  # This is a repository link, which will be available at `tab repo/`, 
  #   or the name overriden in repo/tab.yml
  #
  # The repo tab, and all it's subtabs will be available while within the `advanced-workspace` directory.
  # 
  # No tab.yml configuration is required in the repo folder, though it can be helpful to shorten tab names.
  - repo: repo/

  # This is a workspace link, which will be available at `tab workspace/`, 
  #   or the name overriden in workspace/tab.yml
  #
  # This link from a parent workspace can provide quick lateral navigation between workspaces.
  #
  # A workspace configuration is required at child-workspace/tab.yml
  - workspace: child-workspace/
