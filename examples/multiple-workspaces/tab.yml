# If you end up writing multiple workspaces, 
#  eventually you'll quickly need to switch between them
# You can put a `tab.yml` file in your home directory, which links to your workspaces

# With this configuration, you can use `tab the-workspace` from anywhere,
#   and then tab to repositories within the workspace.

# you can also define a 'home' tab that initializes in your home directory
