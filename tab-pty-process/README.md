# tab-pty-process

This is a fork of [tokio-pty-process](https://github.com/pkgw/stund/tree/master/tokio-pty-process).

Spawn a child process that is connected to a
[pseudo-TTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal), interacting with
it asynchronously using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

This code is essentially a mashup of
[tokio-process](https://github.com/alexcrichton/tokio-process) and
[pty-rs](https://github.com/hibariya/pty-rs). It is more strongly derived from
the former.
