CONFIG:
    Tab can be configured with `tab.yml` files in your workspace and repository roots.

    Using these configs, tab will provide a permanent list of tabs, print docstrings, and 
      automatically set your working directory.

    Examples are available at: https://github.com/austinjones/tab-rs/tree/master/examples

AUTOCOMPLETE:
    `tab` supports dynamic autocomplete for tab selection.

    Setup instructions are available at https://github.com/austinjones/tab-rs

SECURITY:
    The tab daemon listens for authenticated WebSocket connections on the 127.0.0.1 address.

    The daemon requires the following to accept any connection:
      - The request must include a 128 byte auth token, stored in the file: `~/.tab/daemon-pid.yml`.  
          On unix operating systems, the file is assigned the permissions `600`.
      - The `Origin` header must not be present in the request.  
          This prevents any connection from your browser.
      - Websocket listeners bind to `127.0.0.1`.  
          This should prevent any attempted connections from the local network.
