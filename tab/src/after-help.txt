CONFIG:
    If provided configuration, tab will provide a list of permanent tabs, print docstrings, and 
      automatically set your working directory.
    
    Create a `tab.yml` in your workspace root, and one more for each repo you wish to customize.

    Examples are available at: https://github.com/austinjones/tab-rs/tree/master/examples

SECURITY:
    The tab daemon listens for authenticated WebSocket connections on the 127.0.0.1 address.

    The daemon requires the following to accept any connection:
      - The request must include a 128 byte auth token, stored in the file: ~/.tab/daemon-pid.yml
      - The request's Origin header must not be set.  This prevents any connection from a browser.

    The authentication code has very strong unit test coverage.
